I have a new task requirement. Its a simple one. Pls go through the task details and let me know if you can get this executed.

Thanks

Currently, my script is Printing the following stats on the Histogram : 
Mean = 
Std deviation =
Median = 

Where my histogram has "wake time" on the X- axis and "Occurances" on the Y-axis.My histogram prints the Number of wakes.

This is what i want my histogram to print now , KEEPING THE OLD stats calculated : (Task for you TO DO)

No of wakes < 5s = 
No of wakes > 5s & < 10s =
No of wakes > 10s  & < 20s =
No of wakes > 20s  & < 30s =
No of wakes > 30 s = 

These stats should get printed on the graph as well and also on the results.txt file that I am uploading to the google drive.. 

Note - this calculation we need  for Histogram only and for Channel1 - Host only. So keep /or set the min-wake_time (Host_min_wake time) for HOST and histogram as 3sec and greater.

Do not do this for any other channels at all.

On the Histogram (at the top right hand corner ) make sure to print the below results calculated and also move the current (mean ,std ,median values from the place itï¿½s getting printed to the the top right hand corner of the graph) and Results.txt also should have these values in .


Histogram Stats

No of wakes < 5s = 
No of wakes > 5s & < 10s =
No of wakes > 10s  & < 20s =
No of wakes > 20s  & < 30s =
No of wakes > 30 s = 

Mean = 
Std deviation =
Median = 

Command to run the script :

shruthireddy-macbookpro:downloads shruthireddy$ python /Users/shruthireddy/Downloads/x-test.py --file /Users/shruthireddy/Downloads/X1-Test.csv --channel1 HOST --channel2 WIFI --channel3 NCP --channel4 CELLULAR --build test 

or 

shruthireddy-macbookpro:downloads shruthireddy$ python /Users/shruthireddy/Downloads/x-test.py --file /Users/shruthireddy/Downloads/X1-Test.csv --channel1 HOST --channel2 WIFI --channel3 NCP --channel4 CELLULAR --build test --plot-only on

Hi ,

PFA the below module. Pls keep this module in the same folder as the other script is when you are running . 

Also you need to have the following packages to run the script :

pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
pip install httplib2
pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client
pip install pydrive

You can comment out that part where its uploading to google drive and run the script for now. Since that is not necessary as of now.

Thanks

The csv has 4 channels of current values along with time /sample number.
Now these current samples are got from a device that is  tested. 
Using the script we are calculating a few values like : Wake interval , wake time , idle time , wake current , overall current , total wakes, total wake time , total idle time , total test time. 
So You can see below that for each channel we do the calculations and print the graphs respectively. 



Now what I am looking for is the histogram - So the histogram prints number of wakes . 

X axis is the wake time that the device under test was awake , now this wake time is calculated based on the channel 1 host current values. 
Y axis is the number of occurrences i.e the number of times a wake has occurred . For e.g. 100 wakes which were awake for 10 seconds , 15 wakes which has a wake time of 3 sec etc


So you need to only concentrate on the histogram stats generation that I have asked for. For this you need to only make sure you change the Host_min_wake time to 3 sec or greater.

Then you need to make sure in the histogram plot generation part you actually put the limits as I mentioned :

Histogram Stats

No of wakes < 5s = 

No of wakes > 5s & < 10s =

No of wakes > 10s  & < 30s =

No of wakes > 30 s = 



Mean = 

Std deviation =

Median =

I have attached below 4 graphs and a histogram as an example of how the graphs look when i run the script with any csv that we generate.

Pls ping me if you have any questions

Thanks
